# CEQUEAU Hydrological Model

Welcome to the official documentation for the CEQUEAU hydrological model. CEQUEAU is a distributed hydrological model designed for simulating watershed hydrology.

## About CEQUEAU

CEQUEAU is a spatially distributed hydrological model that divides a watershed into square grid cells, called "carreaux entiers" (whole squares), which are further divided into "carreaux partiels" (partial squares) based on watershed boundaries. The model simulates various hydrological processes including:

- Snow accumulation and melt
- Evapotranspiration
- Surface and subsurface flow
- Channel routing
