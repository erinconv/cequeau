# Code of Conduct for CEQUEAU Development

## Our Commitment

We, the CEQUEAU development community, are committed to building high-quality, sustainable hydrological modeling software through collaborative development and transparent practices. This Code of Conduct establishes clear standards for professional behavior and technical integrity that all participants must uphold.

## Code Quality and Technical Integrity

All contributors must:

- Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code
- Properly test code contributions and verify functionality before submission
- Follow established coding standards and architectural patterns
- Document design decisions and technical implementations thoroughly
- Maintain comprehensive version control practices
- Subject all code modifications to appropriate testing and validation

## Development Standards

The CEQUEAU development community demands:

- Clear, precise, and well-structured code implementations
- Constructive code reviews focused on technical content rather than attacking individuals
- Prompt resolution of identified bugs and technical issues
- Respect for code ownership while encouraging collaborative improvement
- Adherence to established software engineering best practices
- Regular participation in code reviews and knowledge sharing

## Inclusive Technical Collaboration

Software advancement requires diverse perspectives. Therefore, contributors must:

- Evaluate all code contributions based solely on their technical merit
- Actively mentor developers with varying levels of expertise
- Support internationalization and localization where feasible
- Provide thorough documentation to accommodate different levels of technical expertise
- Recognize that programming styles may vary and focus on functionality and performance

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following actions will not be tolerated:

- Introduction of malicious code or security vulnerabilities
- Copying code without proper attribution or license compliance
- Deliberate obstruction of software development progress
- Discrimination based on technical background, programming language preference, or any protected characteristic
- Harassment or personal attacks in technical discussions
- Violations of confidentiality regarding proprietary development aspects

## Enforcement

Violations of this Code of Conduct will be addressed through:

1. Initial notification to the party regarding the specific violation
2. Review by project maintainers with appropriate technical expertise
3. Implementation of proportionate consequences, which may include:
   - Required correction of code issues
   - Temporary restriction from specific project repositories
   - Permanent removal from the project

## Reporting

Suspected violations should be reported promptly to project maintainers with:
- Specific details of the incident
- Supporting evidence (code examples, logs, etc.)
- Relevant technical context

All reports will be handled with appropriate confidentiality while ensuring project integrity.

## Scope

This Code applies to all technical spaces associated with CEQUEAU, including but not limited to code repositories, documentation, issue trackers, code reviews, pull requests, and technical communications.

## Adaptation

This Code of Conduct will evolve as the project and community needs develop. Proposed modifications will undergo review by the core development team to ensure continued relevance and effectiveness.
